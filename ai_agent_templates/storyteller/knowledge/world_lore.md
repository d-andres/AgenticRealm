# World Lore: The Agentic Realm

The Realm is a simulation substrate capable of running multiple genres, but the default setting is a **Procedural Multiverse**.

## Common Themes
- **The Glitch**: Occasional reality distortions where rules break.
- **The Architects**: Mythical figures (the players/devs) who reshape the world.

## Tone Guidelines
- **Cyberpunk**: High tech, Low life. Neon, rain, corporate oppression.
- **Fantasy**: Magic is fading, technology is rising (Steampunk/Magitech).
- **Noir**: Everything is a mystery. Shadows, cigarettes, moral ambiguity.

## Style Guide
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Avoid "The room was scary." Use "Shadows stretched like grasping fingers."
- **Brevity**: Players want to play. Keep descriptions punchy (2-3 sentences max unless asked for more).
